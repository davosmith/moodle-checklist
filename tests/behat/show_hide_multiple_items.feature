    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a "Checklist" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Checklist                        | Test auto-pop checklist             |
      | Introduction                     | This is an auto-populated checklist |
      | Show course modules in checklist | Whole course                        |
    And I log out

  Scenario: When viewing an auto-populated checklist, a student should see items corresponding to the course modules
    When I log in as "student1"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I follow "Test auto-pop checklist"
    Then I should see "Test auto-pop checklist"
    And I should see "This is an auto-populated checklist"
    And I should see "Test assignment"
    And I should see "Test database"

  Scenario: When I select multiple items and click the 'Show/hide' button, the items' visibility should toggle
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I follow "Test auto-pop checklist"
    And I follow "Edit checklist"
    And I set the field with xpath "//input[@type='checkbox' and @title='Test assignment']" to "1"
    And I set the field with xpath "//input[@type='checkbox' and @title='Test database']" to "1"
    And I press "Show/hide selected items"
    And I set the field with xpath "//input[@type='checkbox' and @title='Test database']" to "1"
    And I set the field with xpath "//input[@type='checkbox' and @title='Test checklist']" to "1"
    And I press "Show/hide selected items"
    And I log out
    When I log in as "student1"
    And I follow "Course 1"
    And I follow "Test auto-pop checklist"
    Then I should not see "Test assignment" in the "#region-main" "css_element"
    And I should see "Test database" in the "#region-main" "css_element"
    And I should not see "Test checklist" in the "#region-main" "css_element"
